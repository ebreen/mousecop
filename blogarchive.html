<p>Summer please come quick</p>
<p>As I type this, it's the beautiful month of April here in the northeast.</p>
<p>March has a special way of fucking us over, granting us 65F+ days on
the regular. Hopeful start to Spring. And then April comes, and you know
what the Earth does? Below freezing days. They call it "Fools Spring"
up here for a reason. Please (early) Summer, come quick. My fatass is
sitting here typing this up and I haven't hiked in months.</p>
<p>Weather aside, while I have been to many shows in the past month, I
can safely say that for the first time in my life in years there's
really not enough going on for me to go on a long tangent about it.
Monotony is something you come to thank at this point in your life, as
it speeds up days by an insane degree, but I'll admit, I do worry about
how that will translate over at the end of college.</p>
<p>Which I suppose brings me to this next point-- I am almost done with
my spring semester. Yes, that will mean no more B/W shots for a while
(hoping I secure advanced in the Fall), but more importantly, it'll mean
I am done with Junior year. I've already hit the age of 21. Now it's
just downhill from here. No more milestones. Just riding shit out.</p>
<p>I'm worried for senior year. It'll be weird that the youngest people
that I would go to school with will be at least 3 years younger than me.
It'll be weird to think that I'm almost done with undergrad studies. If
I don't get approved for the masters program, it'll just be pure
adulthood. I don't really like how quick it's going now.</p>
<p>Enough existentialism.</p>
<p>I went to a show on 3.28.25. Be on the lookout for when that
writeup/gallery (whatever I choose to do with it) goes up. There's
awesome photos I want to share from it!</p>
<p>Also, not to brag, but I just secured a pair of made in USA Converse
All Stars in my size for a very reasonable price. Perhaps I should do a
page on my site solely dedicated to Converse collecting? Hmm...</p>

<p>Exciting things are happening on vibracobra.net</p>
<p>This is something I wanted to do for a while...</p>
<p>I added a new photo gallery displaying my darkroom work from
2021-2025! Go to the 2025 tab to see some of my new work. I've been back
in the darkroom again and I am sharpening my craft. One of those photos
shows my face... oooo. Face reveal of the webmaster. If you had an
image of me in your head, you'd be correct.</p>
<p>Of course there's a gap between 2023-2024 because I did not have access to a darkroom in that time. :<</p>
<p>More works to come in the future. I've only developed 4 rolls thus
far but hope to take my setup to a show and get some exciting photos.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>It's fine</p>
<p>I think that in life things happen and you got to learn and move on</p>
<p>Moving on as a concept can seem passive-aggressive if you're being
told to do so but in a way it's the best possible way to let the water
flow under the bridge</p>
<p>The past month has been rough for me, lots of severed ties. The one
thing I leave with it all is the fact that I can further focus on
myself, my pursuits, my ambitions.</p>
<p>Breakups are tough. But after a few days, you kinda forget that they happened. It's just life</p>
<p>I would frequently talk on this little blog about how terrible
university is going for me, how I'm constantly 'mentally drained'... For
the first time in a while, my academics are looking up. Perhaps this
will be the semester I can above a 3.5 in? Alongside that, with my
sudden departure from my massive college club as an administrative
member, Life is quiet in a good way. No more needless responsibilities</p>
<p>My site has a heavy emphasis on photography, but for the past year,
there had been times where I was genuinely not dabbling in photography
because of my busy busy life. I could make a site dedicated to
college-run radio stations, geography, urban planning... but who the
hell wants to hear about my jobs? Respectfully I do love my internship
in geography and in some ways still have a soft spot for college radio
stations, but those are supposed to take up a different part of my
headspace, and not some section on my little website.</p>

<p>It's terrible again</p>
<p>So uh. Yeah</p>
<p>My relationship fell through, sudden break up. Don't know how I can
respond. She just dropped it on me. She had her valid reasons I suppose,
pleading to me that "it's not you it's me. you deserve someone better. I
don't think I have enough time" I've had this happen to me before.</p>
<p>Which is why I am tired of it, drained of energy, and hopeless. I don't think I can tell her anything after her sudden message.</p>
<p>I will crawl back into my hole, get away from people, focus on myself
more. It's miserable. The college station has already ruined me. I
don't know who to lean on now.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have gotten rid of my PDX-10 and replaced it with a
HVR-A1U. Little funny guy! I talk a lot about my video gear but I've
never actually uploaded any of my work to here. I'll be placing some
Vimeo links up soon in a new page once I create an account.</p>

<p>Moving on</p>
<p>2025 so far has been a lot of changes, mostly positive.</p>
<p>After a couple failed relationships, I'm finally in one where it
feels so genuine that I've never realized how much I needed it... :')</p>
<p>I've decided to forever part ways with the college radio station I
was a part of. I talked about it much in 2023 when I was at my most
active, but in recent months I was being actively mistreated and
disrespected in my administrative role in the station, and decided that
it was not worth it. Since I've left I've been in a much better mood
overall. Thanks for the fun times and for wasting the first half of my
time in university, I guess.</p>
<p>Some of my recent videography work got a lot of publicity and was
praised by many people. Feels nice upgrading to the HVR-Z1U now, and I'm
hoping to go exciting places with my much better set up. Purchased an
HVR-A1U as a secondary HD camcorder and a capturing deck (wouldn't
really want to use the Z1U strictly for field work and capturing). If
you still use DV tape in the field, you'd understand the importance of
having a deck as opposed to your main camera being your deck.</p>
<p>Positive things happen in your life and you feel like you have lots
of control over the trajectory of things... like academics, job stuff...</p>
<p>Despite 2025 feeling globally like the U.S. is eating its own tail,
so far the year has been good to me personally. Hopefully the year will
be great for all of you as well. :)</p>

<br class="divider">
<p>Yeah!!!</p>
<p>Everything is going very well!</p>
<p>Lots of good things are happening in my life. My birthday is tomorrow, turning 21 finally.</p>
<p>Getting new camcorder right now. PDX10 broke after 3 months of use. 0 hours on all of the use, only 50 threads on the settings.</p>
<p>I am getting a Sony HVR-Z1U (HDV) as a replacement. Finally moving onto HD in 2025 LOL</p>

<p>New year... Kinda terrifying to think we're now mid way through the decade. Anyhow, wrote up a whole ass essay <a href="https://vibracobra.net/something3.html">here</a>. Read it if you want to waste your time!</p>
