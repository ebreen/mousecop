<p>Spring is momentous now. No more annoying cold, just rain. And warmth. Yeahahahahaha</p>
<p>Semester is almost over. What can I learn from it? You can't please
everyone. Nope. Nuh-uh. You can do everything right in life, however,
there will always be someone out there that will unconditionally despise
you and do everything they can to ruin you.</p>
<p>Next year is senior year, which means I'm gonna be an oldhead. a
veteran. elderly. What's nice about being 21 is drinking alcohol and not
feeling like your some kid trying to fit in too much or seem like an
adult, and getting drunk feels less "risky" I guess.</p>
<p>I just went a fantastic and very special show last night, which won't
be posted until the 4.17 show goes up, which will be very soon.</p>
<p>tis tha updates</p>
